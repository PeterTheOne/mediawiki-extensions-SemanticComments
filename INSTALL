Installation instructions for SemanticComments v1.0
------------------------------------------------------------

Requirements: 
=============

SMW 1.8 / MW 1.19

Installation:
=============

Copy the folder SemanticComments into 
the extensions folder of MediaWiki. SemanticComments will then already work, if you 
activate it in LocalSetting.php (see below). 

Activating SemanticComments
---------------------------

The extension is activated by adding the following lines to LocalSettings.php:

include_once('extensions/SemanticComments/SemanticComments.php');
enableSemanticComments();

Import of the ontology
----------------------

SemanticComments comes with a small ontology to provide functionality
for displaying and querying existing comments and some icons.

For that go to Special:Import, select and upload '/extensions/SemanticComments/import/SemanticComments.xml'

To use the delivered icons you need to upload the following files in your wiki:
'/extensions/SemanticComments/skins/icons/bad_active.png'
'/extensions/SemanticComments/skins/icons/neutral_active.png'
'/extensions/SemanticComments/skins/icons/good_active.png'
'/extensions/SemanticComments/skins/icons/defaultuser.gif'
'/extensions/SemanticComments/skins/icons/Comment_icon_crystal.png'
Please be sure that you keep the original file names.

Now you can enter {{ShowComments|show=True}} to any article where you want to get a
list of all 'related comments' and a form that allows you to enter new comments. 


Options:
========

All configuration options are defined and described in /SemanticComments/SemanticComments.php.

To reformat the style of existing comments or of the comment form, use the provided Cascading Style Sheet in '/skins' directory.
